# Art Statement
I wanted to experiment with TouchDesigner to make an immersive experience— creating interactive visuals and using calming audio to evoke curiosity and serenity from users. This project promotes interest, as the blue screen seems boring at first, but once interacted with, it drives you to guide yourself through the water-like surface.
# Instructions
The surface can be interacted with via mouse input, or touch screen input.
# Installation
For an installation, the goal would be having the media interacted with via touchscreens; it would fill out every wall space possible, so the surface can be interacted with anywhere in the room. This project should also be experienced in a dark room, with blue and yellow lights moving around the walls and ceiling. There would be speakers in the center of the room, covered in pool and beach items, playing the selected song.

# Future Plan
In the future, I plan to add some water sound effects for when users interact with the surface, to make it more realistic and fun. I will also add background visuals, such as jellyfish or coral, to make the space feel more like an underwater experience.
