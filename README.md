# Water-You-Waiting-For
Interact with the water, and let it guide your curiosity! 
# Art Statement
I wanted to experiment with TouchDesigner to make an immersive experience— creating interactive visuals and using calming audio to evoke curiosity and serenity from users. This project promotes interest, as the blue screen seems boring at first, but once interacted with, it drives you to guide yourself through the water-like surface.
# Instructions and Installation
The surface can be interacted with via mouse or touch screen input, but for an installation, the goal would be having the water interactive via a touchscreen that fills up a lot of wall space. I’d want this to project to be experienced in a dark room, with blue and yellow lights moving around the walls and ceiling. The interactive surface to be available on every wall space possible, so the surface can be interacted with anywhere in the selected space. There would also be speakers in the center of the room, covered in pool and beach items, playing the selected song; there would be some speakers on the ceiling as well, playing water effects when someone interact with the water surface.
